<p>For the robot assistant, doctor can go inside the code for editing conversation to make dialog more efficient to cure patient.
The purpose of the robot is for automatically reducing doctor's usual works on small diseases, such as cold, cough, running nose or answering basic questions for coronavirus. In other words, The assistant can automatically help
doctor's usual works. Doctor can spend more time on curing bigger diseases. There's a story that doctor mostly spend 8 hours a day on curing cold, cough, fever and tedious problems.
It waste doctor's ability and cause doctor bored on their work. The assistant can help doctor do more important things on curing more serious diseases on patients.
Moreover, the assitant is still beta version but it also can easily deploy to any other healthcare company of websites.</p>
